                    Cover crops help prevent soil erosion, regulate moisture, attract pollinators, assist in weed and
                    pest management, serve as mulch and the source of green manureand organic matter, and are used for
                    grazing or forage. Depending on the types of cover crops, they add or uptake nitrogen.

                As the name hints, these are plants to cover soils for certain reasons. Unlike primary species, they
                support secondary farmerâ€™s needs rather than are grown for trade or human consumption. They improve
                soil health, boost yields, and feed the cattle. However, it does not mean that these plants are some
                exclusive species.
                In alternative situations, they serve as cash cultures, and you can find them on the plate as well
                (for example, buckwheat or corn). The difference is that in the case of fall cover crops, these
                species are used as grasses.
            
                Farmers plant them in different seasons, either fall or late spring/summer, uniformly or between rows.
                Some are winter-killed, and some require removal and residue management.
                This practice is strongly welcomed in crop rotation, no-till, and organic farming. Smart farming
                online tools assist in making knowledgeable decisions.

                Types Of Cover Crops
                There are three main categories, depending on their properties and options for use: grasses, legumes,
                and broadleaf non-legumes. In most cases, they combine several functions at a time,
                like preventing erosion, improving soil quality, serving for grazing, among others.
            
                Benefits Of Cover Crops
                Farmers plant cover crops to improve soil for certain reasons.
            
                Soil Health And Fertility
                Roots of cover crops help prevent erosion from water and wind. Some species can adjust nutrients to more
                ingestible forms for other cultures. Planting cover crops between rows, farmers get mulchas part of
                integrated weed management. Furthermore, flowering inter-row species attract pollinators.
